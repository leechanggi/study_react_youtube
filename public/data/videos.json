He fell into psychosis and began spending all his time alone in his bedroom planning mass murder. He was aiming big, hoping to assassinate the prime minister Justin Trudeau, but he would start small - in his own home, murdering his own mother.\n\nListen to my true crime episodes as a podcast:\nhttps://bit.ly/3qtVG20\n\nRequest a case - https://www.videoask.com/fsuda4gnk\n\nMy second channel -  @ellieneale1  \n\nMy Links - https://linktr.ee/eleanorneale\n\nBusiness - EleanorNeale@sixteenth.co\n\nDisclaimer: I mean no disrespect to anyone that I talk about in this video.
